This is my very basic tic tac toe game. 

It was coded for my Flatiron application. 

A few things to note:
This game has some limitations--I'm still learning!
It does not successfully recognize if there is a tie and quit the game for you. 
It checks the board after each player makes a move to see if a winning combination has been acheived. I would prefer it to keep track of how many turns each player has had and only beginning checking for winning combos after a player has had 3 turns. 

I began coding it using OOP after reading Chris Pine's "Learn to Program" and completing the OOP tutorials on Code Academy. It was too complicated for me however so, after a few days of playing around with classes and objects, I returned to the basics.
